My journey into the world of media, design, and photography began with a deep love for creativity and a desire to tell stories through visual media. My academic journey started with a study in photography, where I discovered the art of capturing moments and emotions. As a photographer, I learned to pay attention to detail and the power of visual communication. This has been a valuable foundation for my current studies in Media and Information Design. What drives me is the pursuit of innovative solutions and creative approaches to complex challenges. I believe that every design tells a story and conveys a message, and I strive to convey that message as powerfully and effectively as possible. My portfolio reflects my dedication to creating meaningful, aesthetic, and purposeful designs, drawing from the experience and aesthetic sensibility I gained during my photography studies. I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and share my passion for media, information design, and photography. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope that my work inspires you and encourages further discussions and collaborations. Let's embrace creativity and innovation together!
